#1 - Plaintiff (The party who presumably suffered an injury, and is suing for recovery of that injury).

#2 - Respondent (The person who "responds" to the lawsuit, or has to answer, otherwise faces a "default judgement," meaning the plaintiff gets what they asked for, provided their request is within reach of the scope of authority / jurisdiction under which the lawsuit was filed. In criminal cases, this party normally referred to as the "Defendant," however, Competent Counsel seeks to advise anyone making use of "our" templates to "respond" as "respondent," so as to initially inure ourselves to proper terminology. The Plaintiff wants you to defend. You will respond to quash, in many cases, and as well you should be, you will always be vexed by spurrious litigation which bogs down the courts and has no chance of availing itself against someone who is competently counseled in matters relative to their rights in a proper court of Law, duly sworn to uphold our Constitution(s), and most importantly, our individual rights. In plurally referring to the Constitution, we refer to both the State and Federal Constitution(s), which are supposed to complement one another under the Federalist model of a Democratic-Republic. While they do complement one another today, the effect by which the ends walk our streets means our judiciary in extricating the rights of Americans is not a good thing for any average American. However, this was accounted for by the founders, and we do yet have a clear path to recovery from the injuries we sustained. Something tells Ol' CC that we're heading that direction, "quick, fast, and in a hurry.")

#3 - Witness - (A person whose knowledge or expertise about subject matter or generally are called upon during a trial for the aide of either the Plaintiff, or the Respondent.)


DISCLAIMER: Until this course is further developed, please do not use it as a sole body of information relative to what we need to competently enter a courtroom, or even make a filing. Also, our filings must be truthful, and while that's not difficult to do, nor should we desanctify our courts by allowing a man who might occupy that seat of justice to break the law wantonly, it could get anyone inexperienced into a difficult situation if they tried to make a pleading in live court without more than the information as yet provided. Please do all appropriate diligence, and feel free to point any public officials our way if they have any questions as to our mission and our incorporation.
