Plaintiff #1 (The party who presumably suffered an injury, and is suing for recovery of that injury).

Respondent #2 (The person who "responds" to the lawsuit, or has to answer, otherwise faces a "default judgement," meaning the plaintiff gets what they asked for, provided their request is within reach of the scope of authority / jurisdiction in which the lawsuit was filed. In criminal cases, this party normally referred to as the "Defendant," however, Competent Counsel seeks to advise anyone use our templates to "respond" as "respondent," so as to initially inure ourselves to proper terminology. The Plaintiff wants you to defend. You will respond to quash, in many cases, always vexed by spurrious litigation which bogs down the courts and has no chance of availing itself against someone who is competently counseled in matters relative to their rights in a proper court of Law, sworn to uphold our Constitution(s). In plurally referring to the Constitution, we refer to both the State and Federal Constitution(s), which are supposed to complement one another under the federalist system. While they do complement one another today, the means by which that is accomplished in extricating the rights of Americans is not a good thing for any average American, however, we do have a clear path to recovery from the injuries we sustained; and something tells Ol' CC that we're heading that direction, "quick, fast, and in a hurry."
